<p>I go by the name of Refilwe Precious Mokhoeya and I am 19 years of age. My hobby is skateboarding.My skateboarding name is Skivvygee.I started skating when it was
covid 19 times, which it was 2021. I started skateboarding because the things I used to do before this pandemic ,I couldn’t do them no more.Everything was closed and 
in a certain time we were supposed to be home. Skateboarding was something that I fell In love with in a snap of my fingers.Skateboarding taught me a lot about life
in general but giving lesson through skate language.But at first when I used to see people skate around it did not bother me of I want to skate too.My first time 
skating I bought a fake board ,which made people laugh but also they helped me get proper materials for my board.They helped me to even start pushing ,doing tricks 
and helped me get a new set of a board.In skateboarding I have found brothers and sisters.I have a family that is always there for you with out them knowing that 
they really heal me from the things I cannot talk about.Another thing that made me to join skateboarding was because I was being bullied and having skateboarding as 
my hobby it changed everything because to me it’s a therapy session when it skating session.It taught me that ,no matter how life it could be never give up ,even how 
many times you failed.It showed me that nothing is impossible in life and what ever you want you should put your heart into it and you will succeed with flying
colours. I could say I am very passionate about it.I started to have a family ,that I never thought I could have in my life.Having to think that being
bullied was the thing I got used to and in my being bullied journey I was told that no one will ever love me or even want be friends with me.Looking where I am at now gives me 
tears because being me was the only thing that people wanted and they really falling in love with me not the fake me.

<p>Here I got a chance to work with Levi’s and this was the best time of my life.Levi’s is my favourite brand ,so when I heard that islandgalsshred has also selected
me to be part of this opportunity, it was very overwhelming.This experience was something that I did not even think I will ever have be part of.Islandgalsshred and 
Yougogirl is a community of girls that skate and also it gives other girls that cannot skate a chance to know how too ,because we give lessons and also provide boards.
Community of girls also they are people that you could actually call them sisters.We all one group of girls that really support each other no matter what.As we girls 
we understand another girls pain ,so that’s why we love being around each other because some girls are scared to skate around other boys. Us giving girls this plate 
form is for them to actually be comfortable to skate where boys are not there to watch them.I am not going to lie but it was hard for me to get me again because I had
forgotten who I was.I have worked with Levis and that was the best part of my life.</p>
